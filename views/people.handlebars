                <p> After living in France for over 2 years, my love for wine has grown exponentially. I cannot imagine a single weekend go by without some exquisite country Wine. My passion for wine is just as strong as my passion for Website Creation.  </p>

                <p>I believe that making wine is like creating websites, you have to be patient and think through every detail. You also need to get some excellent people to work with. That's why I think I am lucky.</p>

                 <h4>b00697711</h4>
                <p>All my life I believed in the saying « Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication ».
So, when it comes to making wine, I try to be as simple and natural as possible so the result would be as sophisticated as possible.
So if you want to enjoy the most exquisite wine, Northern Valley is the place!</p>
